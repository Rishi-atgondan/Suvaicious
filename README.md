# Name of the project - Suvaicious

### What is Suvaicious?

###### Suvaicious is a cloud kitchen management and food delivery application. The purpose of this application is to provide healthy and home cooked food to people who are looking for the same. As of now, sellers can register and add their kitchen details into the application. Also, buyers can sign up, login and take up subscriptions for their food orders.


### Why Suvaicious ?

###### As I spoke to my peers and others in my circle as well, I realized that there is a gap in the food accessibility to students and working professionals in cities like Chennai. The customers are looking for healthy, tasty and home made food options because they are facing health issues. That is why I decided to build Suvaicious, a platform which connects customers and home chefs


### Why did I choose Suvaicious ?

###### Apart from the market demand, Suvaicious also creates means for home chefs to have a source of income. Many women who have some extra time in their hands can earn money and also display their excellent cooking skills through Suvaicious. They will also get a sense of satisfaction because the customers are also looking for this type of food.
